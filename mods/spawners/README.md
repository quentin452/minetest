# Spawners Modpack #

Adds multiple spawner blocks. There ara no ABM's used and this modpack is developed with focus on the best multiplayer online server performance.

Currently it works with Animalia, Mobs Animal and Mobs Monster, but other mob mods can be easily added via API.

## Spawners Mobs ##

Let the player craft Mob Spawners. Mobs are spawning randomly in a short intervals. This MOD is giving the option of creating mob farms and grinders.
