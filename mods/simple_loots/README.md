# simple_loots (WIP)

This mod adds simple looting in chests in structures in schemes in "mts" formats, this only occurs when generating a new world.
There may be some bugs or they may not be bugs, maybe just some detail that is missing, like not showing the chest slots, or if there is more than one chest, loot will be added to only one of the chests.
Although it is not a perfect mod, but very simple and made by someone with little knowledge, I believe it can be very useful ..
