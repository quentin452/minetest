# Tortou 

Tortou is a mod that enables players to turn themselves into a turtle and back. Turtles are 
restraint to the 3D grid. The turtle is moved with the same keys as the default player model.  
To turn yourself into a turtle you need to have the privileges fly and noclip and use the command 
to-turtle. This state is not saved, so you will not be a turtle in case you leave and rejoin. To 
turn yourself back, you need to use the command from-turtle. from-turtle sets properties back to 
the values that have been saved with to-turtle.  
It is possible to set the tick duration through the settings menu.
