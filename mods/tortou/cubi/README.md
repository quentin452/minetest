# Cubi 

This mod adds simple cubic mobs to the game. They are restricted to the 3d grid.  
It is possible to customize the maximum amount of mobs and settings related to spawning.  

I partly use textures created by other authors. I also didn't create the punch sound. The 
attributions for the media files are found in the subfolders with the media.
