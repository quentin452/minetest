# Cursor 

Cursor changes the default behavior of the left and right mouse button. Instead of interacting with 
the pointed position or node, the position of the turtle is used.   
Use the left mouse button to replace the wielded item with the node at the turtle position. Use the 
right mouse button to replace the node at the turtle position with the wielded node. Protected 
areas are not affected unless they are not detected by minetest.is_area_protected.  
It also enables the player to increase or decrease the volume affected by these buttons. Only cubic 
sizes with an uneven length between 1 and 11 are allowed (including 1 and 11).
