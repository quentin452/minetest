About this mod mod:
-------------------
This version of Stamina is a modification of the mod.

It not only updates the previous source code to match the modern Minetest Lua API, but strips
out the Hunger altogether to add a "real stamina" system. Stamina is capped at a time limit.

It's really lazy and hacked together, but I did this for a server who I host for my friends and community.
Please improve and send suggestions

Textures are reused from the Stamina mod. It looks fine for now but I may change it in the future if I
decide to care.
