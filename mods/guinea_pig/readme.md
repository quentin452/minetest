# Guinea pig

The guinea pig is a small, loveable rodent often kept as a pet. They can be found naturally in plains biomes and bred with grass and/or hay. They can also be crafted by combining grass with a rat: instant upgrade! Guinea pigs poop pellets that can be crafted into mulch for all your composting needs (bonemeal mod required). They communicate with high-pitched "wheeks" and happy burbles.
